# HTMX todos

A simple todo app created with some cool tools.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the runtime
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) as the server framework
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org) for interactivity

We also use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) as the formatter.

## Get started

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
